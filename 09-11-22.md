# Points of discussion
1. Explain why in eq.11 (polychord paper) the prior volume starting at 1 leads
   to eq 11
2. What do I call the 'space' that we operate in? Parameter space? Likelihood space? Probability space?
3. Is X here fraction of the prior ie prior volume?
4. How is iso likelihood contour drawn?
5. Significant proportion of my citatings are Handley, is this a problem?
6. Can I state that we selected polychord because it is best in high dimensionality?
   \best for cosmology?
7. Word count currently at 5100, only really needs another 1-2k words. Most of the stuff from the paper is very concise. I could easily write more to fill spcae but seems somewhat pointless. Should I?:
8. Work on paper abstract?

# Notes 
1. Average later, then take pmax/pnlo final fig
2. Fix legend problem x
3. Average rmse, n points flagged, change y axis (averaging over posterior) x
4. RFI both flagged and managed at likelihood level x
5. 'truly bayesian sense' to fully bayesian sense at likelihood level x
6. log Bayes factor for norfi is -1 other way round and change to log x

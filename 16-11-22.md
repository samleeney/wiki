## Questions
1. Is my interpretation of your comment on eq 19 correct?
2. - The bottom panel of figure 6 is still wrong. Why would you plot exp(<P>)?
   - When plotting <exp(log(P_max))/exp(logP_NLO)>, yields nan due to some 
     very low weighted but very large (negative) exp(-logP_NLO) values.
3. Figure 6 would look better with a log p axis.
   -We have tried this both ways a few times.
4. Also mention next-to-leading-order correction inclusion
	-with max term now 10x larger, not sure this is needed?
5. Discuss use of first of its kind?
6. Example of something somewhat similar https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.08627.pdf
